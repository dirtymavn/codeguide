# Coding guidelines

## Notation
Only one notation must be choose for the entire project. Different notation can be used to mark different thing (e.g.: variables, functions, etc)

## Spacing
Use proper spacing and avoid non spaced assignments to prevent bad form. `x=44` is a bad form. `x = 44` is a good one. A good form makes it easier to read.
